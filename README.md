## Opentrons OT-2 Open Source Pipetting Robot protocols

Here I share the Python scripts I've wrote to use the [OT-2 Open Source Pipetting Robots](https://opentrons.com/) to automate some molecular biology protocols commonly used in a laboratory of research. The development of these scripts was part of my responsabilities working at the [Multiplex spa](https://multiplex.bio/) company as an Automation Specialist. 


## In this repository you can find
 
**Practice :** This folder contains some scripts I made to learn how to use the robot and some functions

**Protocols :** This folder contains scripts I made to conduct common molecular biology protocols with the OT-2 robot

 * The list of protocols you can find is:
   *  ELISA test
   *  Nucleic acids extraction
   *  PCR
   *  qPCR 
   *  RT
